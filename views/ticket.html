        <h2>Concert</h2>
        <p>
          This is the concert where the music is played by the people and bands
          you love, at a place that, let's be honest, kinda wasn't meant for an
          event like this, or maybe it is and then your experience will suck.
          Either way, you're going to have a 6/10 time and pay 11/10 prices,
          before event fees. So prepare your bank account, this one's gonna
          hurt.

        <h2>Sports Ball Game</h2>
        <p>
          This is the game you've been waiting for! Or not. Ok. It's not. But
          too bad! That team you really wanna see, but for personal reasons?
          Womp womp, it's priced like a championship game. Sucks to suck. And
          this game? You aren't looking to see this team, your team will
          probably lose, and now you're stuck watching it in-person or not at
          all. Pay up for one of the worst experiences you'll ever have in a
          stadium.
